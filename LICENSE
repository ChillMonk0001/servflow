                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2025  Servflow

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, our
General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share
and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you
wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that
you know you can do these things.

Developers that use the GNU AGPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which
gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

A secondary benefit of the AGPL is that it ensures cooperation in the case
of software used over a network: if you modify the program and let users
interact with it remotely, you must also make your modified source code
available to those users.

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion
of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a
pointer to where the full license text can be found.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
